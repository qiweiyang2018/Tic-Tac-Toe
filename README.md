Tic-Tac-Toe Code Challenge

By Qiwei Yang

### Preface

Whenever I develop a software, I always try to define the scope of the
software as detailed as I can, including API, data structures,
expandability, etc. However, I skip this essential step this time
because it is a code challenge. I will try my best to demonstrate my
coding and software design capabilities through the implementation of
this challenge through implementation of this challenge without any
constraints.
